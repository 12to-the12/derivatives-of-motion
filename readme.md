I was bored and wanted to implement the derivatives of motion in a closed system. This is that project.

I would make this as a website but I suck at webdev


If you're tech savvy you can clone the repo and run make to get it working locally:
```
git clone https://github.com/12to-the12/derivatives-of-motion.git &&\
cd derivatives-of-motion &&\
make
```
If you're on windows you'll have to figure it out yourself.


Here's a picture of what the simulation looks like:

It's a lot cooler in motion.
